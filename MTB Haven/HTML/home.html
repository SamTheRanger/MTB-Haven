	<h4 style="color:black">Introduction</h4>
	<p style="color:black">MTB Haven is a site for beginner mountain bikers. This site will be about the type of mountain bikes that suits your need. Whatever you do, there is always a right bike for your needs whether it’s a hardtail or a full suspension. We also have an interesting page about the history of MTB. I started off with a Trek 3500 Disc 2015 as my beginner hardtail MTB and it performed well on road, gravel and trail. However, it wasn't a proper MTB and couldn't handle complex trails and it had a Suntour suspension fork which is alright for beginners. I was looking through a proper hardtail to suit my needs and I ended buying the Cube Attention 2021, a bike that would almost handle everything and change the way I ride. As with every sports, you start off with the least expensive equipment but the price gradually increases as you get more interested. We will be explaining hardtail/full suspension MTB and the history of MTB.</p>
